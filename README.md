# Dengue-in-Bangladesh

This is a project I made to showcase various visualization methods in Tableau. The project attempts to connect Dengue cases in Bangladesh with the weather and levels of rainfall experienced by the nation. I worked with multiple datasets which required some tedious editing before using for visualizations. 

The file upload is a PowerPoint that has all the visualizations from the Tableau Workbook along with some project details.

However, there is a Tableau Public Link for the actual Tableau Workbook, which can be downloaded to see the underlying designs of the project.
